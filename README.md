# Rock Paper Scissors Game 🎮

This is a simple Python implementation of the classic **Rock, Paper, Scissors** game where a user plays against the computer. The game runs for 5 rounds, and the player with the most points at the end wins the game.

## 📝 How the Game Works
1. The game consists of 5 rounds.
2. On each round, the user chooses between **Rock**, **Paper**, or **Scissors**.
3. The computer randomly selects one of the three options.
4. The game compares the user's choice and the computer's choice and determines the winner for that round.
5. The game continues until all 5 rounds are completed.
